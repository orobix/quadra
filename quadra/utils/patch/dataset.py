    Original images and masks (preprocessed if mask_preprocessing is present) will also be saved under
    output_folder/original/images and output_folder/original/masks.
    If patch number is specified the patch size will be calculated accordingly, if the image is not divisible by the
    patch number two possible behaviours can occur:
        - if the patch reconstruction is smaller than the original image a new patch will be generated containing the
        pixels from the edge of the image (E.g the new patch will contain the last patch_size pixels of the original
        image)
        - if the patch reconstruction is bigger than the original image the last patch will contain the pixels from the
        edge of the image same as above, but without adding a new patch to the count.

    Args:

        val_size: percentage of the dictionary entries to be used for validation

        output_folder: root_folder where to extract the data
        save_original_images_and_masks: If True, images and masks will be copied inside output_folder/original/
        area_threshold: Minimum percentage of defected patch area present in the mask to classify the patch as defect
        area_defect_threshold: Minimum percentage of single defect present in the patch to classify the patch as defect
        mask_extension: Extension used to assign image to mask
